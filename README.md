# Lab-3---Player-Control
In this lesson, you program the player’s basic movement, including the code that limits that movement. Since there are a lot of different ways a player can move, depending on the type of project you’re working on, you will not be given step-by-step instructions on how to do it. In order to do this, you will need to do research, reference other code, and problem-solve when things go wrong.
